## Project overview
The MovieLens Recommendation System project aims to develop a recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their past ratings. The goal is to predict and recommend the top 5 movies that a user is likely to enjoy. Leveraging the MovieLens dataset, which contains 100,000 user ratings, this project applies collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies that align with user preferences based on their rating history.

## Business Understanding
## Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the GroupLens Research team, titled "MovieLens Latest Small Dataset." It is a CSV-based dataset containing user ratings, movie information, and additional features relevant for building a recommendation system. You can access it here: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).
The data are contained in the files `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`.

All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).

Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`.

   1.Handling missing values: There were no missing values.
   
   2.Checking for duplicated values: there were no duplicates.
   
   3.Handling outliers: they were left as they were.

   ## Data visualisation

   how ratings are distributed across the dataset to identify trends like whether users tend to give higher or lower ratings.

   examine which genres receive the most ratings as well as the highest average ratings to understand audience preferences.

   identify movies with the highest average ratings and those with the most ratings to determine popular movies. We'll also see whether the results here will be consistent with the 
   analysis of genre popularity

   visualize the ratings trends over time to investigate how ratings have changed over the years.

   check if highly active users tend to rate movies differently compared to less active users.

   ![pic9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4750bad-0063-4614-a45a-c59ad56e7e16)
   investigated new users or movies with very few ratings, which could impact the effectiveness of recommendations.
