## Project overview
The MovieLens Recommendation System project aims to develop a recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions to users based on their past ratings. The goal is to predict and recommend the top 5 movies that a user is likely to enjoy. Leveraging the MovieLens dataset, which contains 100,000 user ratings, this project applies collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies that align with user preferences based on their rating history.
